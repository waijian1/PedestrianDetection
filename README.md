# Pedestrian Detection using yolov4 model

This project implements a pedestrian detection system using the YOLO model and OpenCV. The model is capable of detecting people in real-time using a webcam feed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Torch

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/waijian1/PedestrianDetection.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python pedestriandetection.py
   ```

2. The program will use your webcam to detect pedestrians in real-time.

## Files

- `pedestriandetection.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to ignore in the repository.
